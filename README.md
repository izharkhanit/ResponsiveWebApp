# RESPONSIVE WEB APP

# Notes

## Building and Running Instructions

Solution is going to implement in React with styled hooks.
I am still not satisfied with the completion of the code, I will continue this more for refactor.
Refactor needed in, reusing the components and css and also Separation of concern for components from single components.
Instead of just react create app I feel to continue from my previous git of POCReactArchitecture and just comented out and added new components for header menu inside nav-menu.
Fully working for desktop view and added breakpoint but I want to continue for refactor as well as mobile view design.

## Before running app, ensure that port 8080 is free

Go into repo root and run:

`npm i`

`npm start`
